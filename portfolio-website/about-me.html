                    Hi, I'm Gabriel Laboy, a Computer Science graduate from UMass Amherst with experience in full-stack web development,
                    game design, and systems administration. I enjoy working on creative, technical challenges whether that's building web
                    applications, designing games in Unity, or configuring self-hosted services through my homelab.
                    <br><br>
                    I've contributed to a variety of projects across professional and research settings, from labeling data for machine
                    learning systems at SureScan Corporation, to building energy data tools in academic research, to developing responsive
                    websites and interactive games during a global tech internship. As a Resident Assistant, I also gained valuable
                    experience in leadership, communication, and crisis response.
                    <br><br>
                    I work with languages and tools like Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL, Unity, and Git, and I'm always looking for new ways to
                    learn, build, and create. Feel free to explore my portfolio, check out my games on itch.io, or dive into my code on
                    GitHub.
