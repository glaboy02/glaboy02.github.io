                    Hi, I’m Gabriel Laboy — a senior Computer Science student at UMass Amherst with a passion for creative
                    problem-solving
                    through code and design. My interests span web development, game design, and system administration, and I’m always
                    eager
                    to explore the intersection of technology and user experience.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the past few years, I’ve built a diverse skill set through hands-on roles in research, software development,
                    and
                    IT. I currently work at SureScan Corporation supporting machine learning workflows with detailed image validation,
                    and I
                    serve as a Resident Assistant where I foster community and lead with empathy. My past internships and research
                    experience have helped me develop responsive websites, automate data pipelines, and collaborate effectively in both
                    technical and community-oriented environments.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of academics and work, I’ve built a personal homelab to deepen my understanding of system infrastructure,
                    and
                    I’ve created interactive browser games and Unity projects that reflect my love for playful, impactful design.
                    <br><br>
                    Feel free to check out my portfolio, explore my games on itch.io, or browse my code on GitHub.
