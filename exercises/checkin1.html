        <h1>How to Game Design</h1>
        <p>I am going to talk about how I wish I started Game Design/Developement if I were to completely start over</p>

        
        <h2>Picking Game Engine</h2>
        <p>There are many different Game Engines to choose from for example there are;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://unity.com/pages/unity-pro-buy-now?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=cc_dd_upr_amer_amer-t1_en_pu_sem-gg_acq_br-pr_2023-01_brand-at1_cc3022_ev-br_id:71700000105927797&utm_content=cc_dd_upr_amer_pu_sem_gg_ev-br_pros_x_npd_cpc_kw_sd_all_x_x_brand_id:58700008262791723&utm_term=unity&&&&&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAq-u9BhCjARIsANLj-s0Aj9hEPMbTRDEQJEg-1LIc7fzYon6cfPur1UO6CDj3bKuBerXtBpYaArEIEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Unity</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US">Unreal Engine</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a></li>

            <li>etc....</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Picking a Game Engine that fits for you and the specific type of games you want to make is very important to starting your Game Dev journey</p>
    

        <h2>Places to learn</h2>
        <p>There are plenty of places to learn Game Developement like;
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Coursera</li>
            <li>Udemy</li>
            <li>Youtube</li>
            <li>Books</li>
            <li>etc....</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Looking back now I would start with Youtube to get the basics down of whatever engine you decide to choose. Watch one or two videos on the basics of coding with whatever language your game engine uses. Then maybe watch one full guide on Youtube where they make a game step by step from beginning to end just so you can get more of the basics down and understand the game developement process from start to finish. Then jump straight into making small games that will not take very long. Give yourself a time frame of a week or two and make something small but complete.
            <br>
            <br>
            Do not worry about making it too complicated the simpler the better. This is just to get as much practice as you can. As you get more comfortable with your Engine of choice and coding the games will eventually get better. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Do not get stuck in "Tutorial Hell", which is when you watch too many videos and think you have the skills to make a game with out videos but quickly find out you do not know what to do without the videos. It is best to watch a few videos showing you how to do something then just start making games with the skills you have. If you need help with something search it up on line but do not follow full guides for making one game. Look up your specific problem and fix it that way.
            <br>
            <br>
            Practice practice practice. Put in as many hours in as you can and you will definitely show results. This is one of the most important things I would do if I were to start over. Nothing is more important than this in my opinion.
