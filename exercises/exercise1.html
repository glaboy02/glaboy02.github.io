    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <!-- <p>My name is Gabriel Laboy. I am a student at UMASS Amherst as a Computer Science major. Some of my hobbies are playing Rugby, playing video games with friends and I like to make DIY projects of many different kinds(Tech, Wood working ect..)</p> -->
    <h3>Short Bio</h3>
    <p> 
        My name is Gabriel. I’m a senior at UMass Amherst, into computer science, web development, and game design. I got into coding through a web dev internship, where I built websites, worked on UI/UX, and realized I loved making interactive stuff. That led me to game dev, starting with JavaScript and later getting into Unity. I also love traveling, and those experiences shape how I think about design, tech, and creativity.

    <h3>Long Bio:</h3>
    <p> 
        My name is Gabriel. I’m a senior at UMass Amherst, and I’ve been into coding, web dev, and game design for a while now. It all started with a web development internship where I built websites, played around with UI/UX, and realized I really liked making interactive things. That led me down a rabbit hole into game development, starting with small JavaScript browser games and eventually diving into Unity.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve also taken courses in digital culture, animation, and ethical computing, which got me thinking about how people interact with technology and how to make it more accessible. I’m especially interested in how tech can be more inclusive for people who don’t always have easy access to it. I also love analyzing interfaces and figuring out ways to make them more intuitive and user-friendly.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of coding, I love to travel, and those experiences have given me a fresh perspective on creativity and design. Whether it’s making a game, designing a website, or thinking about ethical tech, I’m always looking for ways to mix creativity with technology to build cool and meaningful experiences.
